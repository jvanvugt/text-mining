# Text Mining Exercise week 4
## By Joris van Vugt

### Introduction
The goal of this assignment was to extract dates (in an arbitrary format) from articles from http://www.biography.com/. The dates then had to be converted to ISO 8601 standard (i.e. yyyy-mm-dd) and presented in a (sorted) table along with the sentence it was extracted from.

### Approach
I used an article on [Mahatma Gandhi](http://www.biography.com/people/mahatma-gandhi-9305898) to find patterns for dates. I concluded that the most frequently used format looks like "January 5, 2016", although some other formats are also used (E.g., no day or only a year). I used regular expressions to find these patterns in the text. The only adjustment I had to make to my NLP program from week 2 was better utf-8 support.

### Results
I've tested my program on the article on [Barack Obama](http://www.biography.com/people/barack-obama-12782369). I extracted 107 dates, all of which were converted to their ISO 8601 formats correctly. `Precision = 107 / 107 = 1`. Although the article on Obama is a lot longer than the one I used for finding patterns, it still worked very well. This is because the dates were formatted very consistently.

### Discussion
Extracting dates is not very difficult when they are consistently and unambiguously formatted. However, some dates might not be very relevant. For example, the last date extracted, 2030, (*"President Obama praised the agreement for establishing the "enduring framework the world needs to solve the climate crisis" and pledged that the United States would cut its emissions more than 25 percent by 2030"*), is not about Obama's life and is a lot less relevant than *"In February 1990, Obama was elected the first African-American editor of the Harvard Law Review"*.
